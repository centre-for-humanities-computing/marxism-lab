Hebrews.txt_10,new_testament, then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron s rod that budded and the tables of the covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation

2Cor.txt_14,new_testament, moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf
